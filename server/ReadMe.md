Here is a list of technologies that you may want to use for the backend of the music-web application, built with Node.js and TypeScript:

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. It is fast, scalable, and lightweight, making it a popular choice for building web applications.

TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that can be compiled to plain JavaScript. It adds features like type checking and interfaces to JavaScript, making it easier to write large and scalable applications.

Express: Express is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to route HTTP requests, handle errors, and build middleware.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that can be used to store data for your application. It is a popular choice for Node.js applications because it has a simple, JSON-like data model and supports a powerful query language.

Mongoose: Mongoose is an object-document mapping (ODM) library that can be used with MongoDB. It allows you to define schemas for your data and provides helpful methods for interacting with the database.

JWT: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard for securely transmitting information between parties. You can use JWT to authenticate users in your application and ensure that only authorized users have access to certain routes or resources.

Nodemon: Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your Node.js server when it detects changes in your code. This can be helpful during development, as you can make changes and see the results without having to manually restart the server.

Jest: Jest is a testing framework that can be used to test your Node.js code. It is fast and easy to use, and includes features like mocking and snapshot testing to help you write reliable tests.
